# Slogo Addition

## Estimation

I believe it will take around two hours to complete this new feature.
I should need to update five or six classes. I will definitely need to make a new Command class, and I may need to add a new set of turtles that get passed around among the parsers/backend classes (the new set of "turtles" will be stand-ins for the stamps). I may also need to adjust one class in the Front-end in order to make sure the stamps get added to the Scene properly after the  Command is parsed (this is what we did for new turtles, and I believe a similar approach will work).
