### Addition

##### Estimation

I think that adding this extension will take around an hour as we already had implemented very similar functionality. 

I will need to edit several properties files, and edit the default panel to have a button that links to my new file. I should only need to create on file.

##### Review

Completing this feature took around an hour and half.

I had to add only one file, however I had to edit two classes, not including properties files, as there was a bug in our original implementation that I had to fix in one of the panels.

I did not get it right on the first try as there was a big in our original implementation that I needed to fix.

##### Analysis
This exercise made me really appreciate our projects design. The fact that I only had to create on additional class to implement this feature really nice, and is an indication that we did a good job making our design open to extension. 

Overall our documentation wasn't great, however the code was extremely readable so that was less of a problem than it otherwise would have been.

The documentation of the code definitely could have been improved. Additionally, while they seemed clear at the times, the class names themselves are not very descriptive. I had to hunt around a far amount to find the classes I was looking for. 

If I wasn't familiar with our code at all this project would have been significantly harder due to our poor documentation. Although the code is readable, if one is completely unfamiliar with the code that doesn't help very much as there are thousands of lines of code.
