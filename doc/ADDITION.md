## Estimation: before looking at the old code:

* How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?

1 hour.

*  How many files will you need to add or update? Why?

3 files. One to create the panel, the CSS file to style the panel, and possibly a class to handle loading image options and changing the image.
